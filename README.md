# OpenLawOffice.Word

Status: Development

## What?
OpenLawOffice.Word is an add-in for Microsoft Word allowing expansion of OLO features into Word.

## Why?

### Why the project?
The only task more difficult than managing a law office without software dedicated to that purpose is swallowing the pricetag hanging on the existing systems.  Worse yet, some public sector lawyers are overworked and underpaid.  OpenLawOffice will step into this field to provide the software to assist these lawyers and support staff to help prevent errors, manage tasks and allow the directors of the departments to put more of the budget in their employee's pockets.  OpenLawOffice is open source software that is freely available to anyone, period.  

### Why your involvement?
It's the new Pro-Bono!  Legal services are expensive, no question.  One large factor in the cost to market for these services is technology.  Almost all aspects of a law department can now be virtualized using technology.  We simply mean to increase the availability of reduced total cost of ownership technology for law office management so these firms and departments can deliver the same or higher quality services to their clients at a lower total cost.


## How?

### Will you stay afloat offering free software?
Contributions and value added services.  For instance, who better to perform your site analysis, setup your servers and bring OpenLawOffice active in your environment than the people writing the program?  As we freely give our time and intellectual property to the development of OpenLawOffice, we simply ask that your installation and support issues get directed to us so we can keep the lights on for the project.
